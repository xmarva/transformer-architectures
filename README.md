# Transformer Architectures

Here I explore and implement transformer architectures. This project is dedicated to explaining the inner workings of transformers, analyzing their key components, and improving their performance in various tasks.

## ðŸš€ Why Transformers Matter

Transformers have revolutionized deep learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. Introduced in the paper *"Attention Is All You Need"*, transformers rely on the self-attention mechanism, which allows them to capture complex relationships in data efficiently.

### Key advantages of transformers:
- **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, transformers process sequences in parallel, significantly improving training speed.
- **Long-range dependencies**: The self-attention mechanism allows transformers to model long-range dependencies in data more effectively.
- **Scalability**: Transformers power state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and ViTs, setting new benchmarks in AI.

## ðŸ“Œ Work in Progress
Here is a list of topics and implementations I am currently working on. Each item is a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to a specific aspect of transformers:

- [ ] **Text Data Preprocessing** 
- [ ] **Transformer Architecture**
- [ ] **Training a Transformer on Real Data**
- [ ] **Enhancing Transformer Architecture**
- [ ] **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** 
- [ ] **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)**
- [ ] **Vision Transformer (ViT)**
- [ ] **CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining)**
- [ ] **Swin Transformer**
